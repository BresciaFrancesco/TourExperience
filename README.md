# TourExperience
An Android app for visiting museums with IoT support.

With the TourExperience app you can be guided to discover the most beautiful and evocative museums in the world and move around them using IoT sensors that will allow you to discover and learn without the help of a tour guide. 

You could choose and save the paths you prefer of a museum, leave reviews on the paths taken, play various minigames for each work present within the path simply by approaching it or scanning a QR code. By completing the minigames you can also get scores to save on your personal ranking that can always be consulted and export and share the results with whoever you want.

The app will guide you on the path without ever letting you get lost, so that you can lose yourself in the beauty that surrounds you and learn as much as possible.

Enjoy!
